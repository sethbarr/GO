# Gene ontology outputs for the whole genome of _Apis mellifera_ and _Bombus terrestris_

In genomic analyses, especially when workign with non-model species, we need to infer gene function from similarity to other species. This means that lots of people are running the same, or similar, analyses on the same genomes, which is a bit silly. 

Here I have uploaded the analyses of the whole European honeybee (_Apis mellifera_ 4.5) and buff-tailed bumblebee (_Bombus terrestris_ 1.0) transcriptomes which was produced using [Annocript](https://github.com/frankMusacchia/Annocript). There is a control file which is the same between the two analyses although point to different fasta files. I have santized the control file to remove personal information and if people would like to analyze their data in a similar way they would need to point to the paths for the relevant programs.


These analyses were run at [East Carolina University](http://www.ecu.edu/cs-cas/biology/) by [Seth Barribeau](http://seth.barribeau.com) with [Dr. Michael Brewer](http://www.michael-brewer.com/Site/About_Me.html)
